# Connectivity Tools

Tools here are for helping determine potential network connectivity problems in your input data.

## Node Check

Generates locations in which there is a potential network connectivity problem.

Tool is looking to confirm spots that might be overlapping, improperly split tee connections, slight overlaps, and more.

From a network perspective, disconnections in a network will not produce an accurate model, so by identifying the potential locations of connectivity errors, corrections can be made early in the QC Stage

## Random Sample Images

Generate a random sampling of the input data. Would be expected to be the node locations, but really can be any point or polyline feature.
